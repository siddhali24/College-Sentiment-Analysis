Education is a crucial decision, and choosing the right college shapes a student’s future. With countless options, students and parents rely on online reviews, but manually analyzing them is time-consuming. A Sentiment Analysis model can automate this process by analyzing reviews and categorizing them as positive ,negative or neutral, helping students get a quick and clear understanding of a college’s reputation

1.Accept the name of a college and review as input from users. Classify the sentiment of these reviews as positive, negative or neutral and give as output.

2.Accept the name of a college as input from users and give the college status based on reviews as positive, negative or neutral.
